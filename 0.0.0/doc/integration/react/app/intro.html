<h1>Integration with React</h1>

        The Studiö Web Components are easy to integrate 
        with <a target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> applications.

    <div class="uk-margin-top">
        Because <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">Web Components</a> 
        are UI framework and library agnostic, 
        the task of integrating with most UI frameworks and libraries is straightforward,
        but in the specific case of React you need to use the provided wrappers for React.
    </div>
    <div class="uk-margin-top site-note">
        The reason you need to use wrappers for React has to do with how React is implemented.
        See <a target="_blank" href="https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/">Custom Elements Everywhere</a> 
        for a list of UI frameworks and libraries, including their level of compliance to the 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">Web Components</a> 
        standards.
        <div class="uk-margin-top">
            Until the issue is solved in React, Studiö includes React wrappers for consumption 
            of Studiö elements from React applications.

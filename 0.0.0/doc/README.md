# studio-doc
This folder contains the public documentation pages for the Studiö Web Components.

The documentation is written using static HTML pages and plain JavaScript where needed to illustrate a point.

You can read the documentation HTML and JS code in order to further look into how to use the components.

This also demonstrates plain vanilla usage of the Studiö Web Components without resorting to an application framework. However we use [UIKit](https://getuikit.com/) in order to apply some basic styling to our documentation.
